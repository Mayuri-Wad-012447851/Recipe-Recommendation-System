Let cool slightly. Coarsely chop zucchini and scallions, then toss with corn. Season with salt and pepper.</p><p>Combine avocado, scallion, tomatoes, cilantro, lime juice, salt, and cayenne in a medium bowl.</p><p>Arrange tortillas on a work surface.

Fold tortillas in half to create half-moons.</p><p>Heat 1 Tbsp. vegetable oil in a large heavy skillet over medium-low until hot, then cook 2 tortillas, turning once, until cheese is melted and tortillas are brown, 1–2 minutes per side. Transfer quesadillas to serving plates, then cook remaining tortillas with remaining oil.
